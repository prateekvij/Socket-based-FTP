closed gracefully by releasing the socket resource.
I am from server
In this assignment, you require to implement two C programs, namely server and client to communicate
with each other based on TCP sockets. The aim is to implement simple Base64 encoding communication
protocol.
Initially, server will be waiting for a TCP connection from the client. Then, client will connect to the
server using server’s TCP port already known to the client. After successful connection, the client accepts
the text input from the user and encodes the input using Base64 encoding system. Once encoded message
is computed the client sends the Message (Type 1 message) to the server via TCP port. After receiving the
Message, server should print the received and original message by decoding the received message, and
sends an ACK (Type 2 message) to the client. The client and server should remain in a loop to
communicate any number of messages. Once the client wants to close the communication, it should send
a Message (Type 3 Message) to the server and the TCP connection on both the server and client should be
closed gracefully by releasing the socket resource.
